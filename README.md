## About The Project

<img src="images/hero.png">

I wasn’t satisfied with any online palette making tools available and I wanted to automate the process of creating palettes for my own work, so I created ‘Palettizer’. I wrote a [Medium article](https://uxdesign.cc/color-palettes-for-design-systems-part-i-f18d7fa1cd98) about the process so you can see how I approached the problem.

I hope find this tool useful for your own design projects. Please reach out with any questions and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/caoimghgin) or connect via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinrmuldoon/).
